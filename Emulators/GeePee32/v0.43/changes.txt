PRIVATE 36
----------
* added   : emulation of 1BPP LCD, primarily used by Mr.Spiv's "boot firmware selector" and "BIOS monitor".

* added   : emulation of eeprom writes, primarily used by Mr.Spiv's "boot firmware selector" and PacRom.
* added   : eeprom is now saved to file (iic.bin) when emulator is closed.
* changed : removed splash screen.
* added   : eeprom data is accessible with memory editor, starting at address 0x15400100 (for debug purposes).
* added   : loading of AXF and ELF files (buggy, but who cares?).
* changed : SMC file is only changed/saved after user confirmation.
* ... and a lot of other stuff I did not keep track of ... (sorry, no sound in this version).

PRIVATE 25
----------
* SMC emulation works directly on virtual smc file instead of being loaded into mem, no caching yet.
* Improved IIC emulation to make pacrom firmware run (very long IIC read time for now).
  Simply place a IIC.BIN file in the same dir as the emu, I've included my own to get you started.
