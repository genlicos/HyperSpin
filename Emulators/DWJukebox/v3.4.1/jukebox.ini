[Display]

# Skin sets the skin definition file.  See default.skn for 
# a sample skin definition file. 
#
# Multiple skins can be specified as Skin1, Skin2, etc.  
# When multiple skins are used, the BTN_SKIN_NEXT and 
# BTN_SKIN_PREV keys can be used to cycle between them, or 
# buttons BTN_SKIN_1 through BTN_SKIN_10 can be used to 
# switch directly to a particular skin.

Skin1 = default
Skin2 = cd4-1


# Width and Height sets the screen resolution.  The skin 
# will be scaled to fit this resolution. Although any skin 
# can be used at any resolution, use skins especially 
# designed for low resolutions for best results below
# 640x480.
#
# Note that the Width and Height are for the monitor, not 
# the display, so even if using a rotated display set the
# Width and Height appropriately for a non-rotated
# horizontal display.
#
# If Width or Height is set to AUTO, the jukebox will use 
# the existing desktop resolution in Windows, or 1024x768 
# in DOS.  The default value for Width and Height is AUTO.

Width = Auto
Height = Auto


# Rotation sets the rotation of the display.
# This value can be specified three different ways; use 
# the one that makes most sense to you.
#
# First, Rotation may be specified in 90 degree 
# clockwise increments.  
# Thus, Rotation = 0 is horizontal, Rotation = 1 is 
# vertical rotated to the right, Rotation = 2 is upside 
# down, and Rotation = 3 is vertical rotated to the left.
#
# Second, Rotation may be specified in degrees, with 0, 
# 90, 180, and 270 being the only supported values.
#
# Finally, rotation may be specified as HORIZONTAL, 
# VERTICAL (or VERTICAL RIGHT), UPSIDE DOWN, or 
# VERTICAL LEFT.
# The default value is 0.

Rotation = 0


# RefreshRate requests a specific refresh rate.  Be 
# careful with this value!  Most monitors will not accept 
# an out of range refresh rate, but some older monitors
# could theoretically be damaged.  If in doubt, do not set
# a refresh rate and the monitor's default will be used.

# RefreshRate = 72


# ColorDepth requests a specific color depth.  When 
# DWJukebox starts up, it will cycle through color depths 
# until it finds one that is supported at the requested 
# resolution.  By default, it tries 16 bits per pixel first,
# then 15, then 24, then 32.  This may cause some undesired 
# flashing on startup, or the selection of an undesired color
# depth.  Setting ColorDepth to either 15, 16, 24, or 32 will
# cause the jukebox to try that color depth first.  Setting 
# ColorDepth to Auto will go in the order listed above.
# Note that selecting an unsupported color depth may cause 
# the jukebox to open in a window in Windows.  
#
# In Windows the AUTO setting will try to use the existing 
# desktop color depth before trying the others. The default 
# is Auto.

ColorDepth = Auto


# FontSmoothing sets whether the text written to the title 
# strips is antialiased (smoothed).  Disabling font 
# smoothing may increase performance on slow machines.
# FontSmoothing has been tested to work at full speed on
# at least a Pentium 166 at 800x600 resolution.

FontSmoothing = True


# If a skin does not perfectly match the rotation, either 
# the height or the with must be either clipped or 
# letterboxed to make the display fit.  
# FixedDimension = Height uses the full height of the 
# skin; FixedDimension = Width uses the full width of the 
# skin. FixedDimension = Auto uses width for horizontal 
# orientations and height for vertical orientations.

FixedDimension = Auto


# The MonitorAspectRatio sets the physical aspect ratio of 
# the monitor, NOT the aspect ratio of the screen 
# resolution. A particular monitor always has the same 
# aspect ratio no matter what resolution it's running in.
# The aspect ratio needs to be set for the monitor in its "natural" 
# configuration, not accounting for the Rotation setting in the jukebox.
# If the display is rotated in hardware by the video card, it needs to be 
# inverted.
#
# Aspect ratios can be specified as an actual ratio (4:3 or 16:9, for 
# example) or as a decimal number representing the ratio (for example, 
# the standard 4:3 aspect ratio can be expressed as 1.3333334, 
# which is roughly 4 divided by 3).  You should only need to 
# change this if you have a widescreen  monitor.  Most widescreen
# monitors use a 16:10 aspect ratio, or 1.6; widescreen TV's or
# monitors with TV-style 720 or 1080 vertical resolutions are usually
# 16:9, or 1.7777778.  
#
# If MonitorAspectRatio is set to STRETCH, the full height and width of 
# the skin will fill the height and width of the monitor and the
# FixedDimension attribute will be ignored.
# 
# The default is 4:3.

MonitorAspectRatio = 4:3


# If the jukebox is set to use credits and a selection 
# button is pressed with no credits available, the message
# specified in InsertCoinMsg1 and InsertCoinMsg2 will be 
# shown on the Upcoming Songs display.  If the Upcoming 
# Songs display is set to only display one line, only 
# InsertCoinMsg1 will be shown.

# MousePointer points to the file containing a set of
# Allegro bitmaps representing the mouse pointers.
# Right now, changing this is only useful if all of
# the pointers have their hotspot in the same spots as
# the default pointer file, as the hotspots are currently
# hardcoded.

MousePointer = jbdefptr.ptr


# AnimationSpeed sets the speed of the page change 
# animations.  This value can range from 2 to 100.
# Since this value represents milliseconds between frames, 
# lower numbers are faster.  Setting the speed to 0 or 
# Disabled disables page change animations. The default 
# value is 20.

AnimationSpeed = 20


# AnimationAcceleration sets the rate at which the page change animation 
# accelerates.  It accepts values from 1 to 100, with 100 being fastest.
# Accelleration only starts to kick in on the third page change, and once 
# the page change button is released for more than a second or two the 
# acceleration resets.  A value of 0 or Disabled turns off acceleration.
# The default value is 20.

AnimationAcceleration = 20


# IconFocusBoxThickness sets, in pixels,  the thickness of the dotted 
# focus line around highlighted icons; TrackFocusBoxThickness sets the 
# thickness of the line around track titles. If set to AUTO, the 
# thickness will depend on the screen resolution; if it is set to 0 or
