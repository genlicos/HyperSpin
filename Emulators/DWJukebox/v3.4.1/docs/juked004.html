(Editor's note: All jukebox features are named with BiCapitalization
rather than using separate words.  This is not for trendy marketing 
reasons; it simply allows the documentation builder to index the
features properly.)

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="PlayStimulator">PlayStimulator</a></b></div><br>

<p>
In a commercial jukebox, a <i>play stimulator</i> is a feature that 
automatically plays a song after a certain period of inactivity; the 
theory is that it essentially reminds patrons that the jukebox is there
which encourages people to use it.

<p>
DWJukebox has an optional PlayStimulator mode that simulates this 
function.  The PlayStimulator can be enabled in JUKEBOX.INI or 
toggled on and off via BTN_PLAYSTIMULATOR. When the PlayStimulator 
is enabled, a random song will play after the selected period of 
inactivity.

<p>
To enable the PlayStimulator via JUKEBOX.INI, set the number of 
seconds the jukebox is to be idle before the PlayStimulator 
kicks in by adding or changing the PlayStimulatorDelay setting 
in JUKEBOX.INI in the [Settings] section:

<blockquote class="code"><pre>
[Settings]
<a href="juked010.html#PlayStimulatorDelay" class="autotype" title="">PlayStimulatorDelay</a> = 180
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This would set the PlayStimulator to 180 seconds, or three minutes.  
Setting this value to 1 will cause the jukebox to play constantly 
as if it were in Radio Mode.  Setting this value to 0 disables the Play 
Stimulator.

<p>
To avoid repetition, the PlayStimulator (and all other functions that
randomly select songs) remembers the last 20 songs played and will 
avoid playing them again.  However, this feature is disabled if the 
jukebox contains less than 40 songs.  Songs higher on the Most Popular
list will be selected for random play more often.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="RadioMode">RadioMode</a></b></div><br>
RadioMode is similar to the PlayStimulator, except it selects a new 
random song as soon as the queue is empty.  Although RadioMode is 
essentially a PlayStimulator with a one-second delay, it is a
separate function to allow both modes to be toggled independently.

<p>
To enable RadioMode via JUKEBOX.INI, set the RadioMode setting 
in JUKEBOX.INI in the [Settings] section to Enabled.


<blockquote class="code"><pre>
[Settings]
<a href="#RadioMode" class="autotype" title="">RadioMode</a> = <a href="juked014.html#Enabled" class="autotype" title="">Enabled</a>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
RadioMode can also be toggled on and off via BTN_RADIO.



<blockquote class="xref"><em><b>See also:</b></em>
<a class="xref" href="juked002.html#BTN_RADIO" title="Toggles radio mode on and off">BTN_RADIO</a>,
<a class="xref" href="juked003.html#MSG_RADIO" title="">MSG_RADIO</a>.</blockquote>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="LoopMode">LoopMode</a></b></div><br>

<p>
In LoopMode, when a song finishes playing it is immediately re-added 
to the end of the queue.  Songs removed with MSG_SKIP are not looped.
Songs added to the queue through this method do not consume a credit,
but they do increase the play count.  LoopMode is useful at parties 
or holiday occasions to keep a particular set of songs on continuous 
play.

<p>
LoopMode is usually enabled or disabled via BTN_LOOP.  It can also be
enabled via the LoopMode setting in the [Settings] section of 
JUKEBOX.INI

<br><center><h2><a name="Song sorting options">Song sorting options</a></h2></center><p>

<p>
There are three options for sorting the songs: Artist (the default),
which sorts the labels by artist; Album, which sorts the labels by
album; and Random, which randomly scrambles the titlestrips as they
would normally appear on a real jukebox.

<p>
To set the song sort, add the SongSort parameter to the [Settings] 
section of JUKEBOX.INI as follows:

<p>
[Settings]
SongSort = Random

<p>
 - or -

<p>
SongSort = Artist

<p>
 - or -

<p>
SongSort = Album


<p><br>
Note that Album sort only applies to album-based (CD-type) skins. If Album
is selected for a classic-style skin, it will be treated as Artist.
