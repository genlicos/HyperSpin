<p>
The jukebox has no configuration options available through the program
itself; all configuration is carried out through text-based
configuration files.

<p>
In order to get up and running quickly, please edit the jukebox.ini file
in a text editor like Windows Notepad or DOS Edit and set the SongPath 
to point to your music collection. You may set multiple song paths, so 
if you have more than one folder of music, set SongPath1, SongPath2, etc. 
Please note that if one of your SongPaths is in a subfolder of another 
SongPath, songs will get indexed twice and updates may not be stored 
properly.  This will be enough to get the jukebox running with the 
default skin and contols.

<p>
The first time the jukebox is run, it will index all of the song files.
For large collections, this step can be time-consuming, as each song 
must be completely loaded into memory to be searched for identification
information.  This information is saved in a song database, so on 
subsequent runs, the jukebox only needs to verify the existence of the 
file.  This verification step allows you to use removable media; songs 
will only be displayed on the jukebox if they exist when the jukebox is 
started.

<p>
<br><center><h2><a name="Configuration Files">Configuration Files</a></h2></center><p>

<p>
The configuration files used by DWJukebox are plain text files.  They are 
organized similar to Windows INI files; they contain a number of 
parameters divided into sections, with the section names starting in 
square braces. Lines that start with the # character (pound, octothorpe, 
number sign, whatever you want to call it) are comments and are not
read by the jukebox.  For example, here is a section with two parameters:

<blockquote class="code"><pre>
[Settings]
# This section contains jukebox settings.

<a href="juked004.html#RadioMode" class="autotype" title="">RadioMode</a> = Disabled
<a href="juked010.html#MaxQueueSize" class="autotype" title="Sets the maximum number of songs that can be queued.">MaxQueueSize</a> = 250
</pre></blockquote>


<p><br>
Three configuration files are used to determine the operation of
the jukebox:

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="JUKEBOX">JUKEBOX</a>.INI</b></div><br>
This file contains all settings related to operation of the program
itself, and general user preferences. Anything related to the physical
PC, such as resolution or refresh rate, or jukebox operator settings,
such as whether or not to require credits, are set in this file. You can
specify a different configuration file on the command line when starting
the jukebox; for example, starting the jukebox with WINCAB.EXE
MYPREFS.INI will use MYPREFS.INI instead of JUKEBOX.INI.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="Control">Control</a> Map File</b></div><br>
The control map file assigns jukebox functions to individual keys,
joystick or gamepad buttons and axes, or mouse buttons. The default
control map file is CONTROLS.INI; however, a different file can be
selected via the Controls parameter in JUKEBOX.INI.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="Skin">Skin</a> File</b></div><br>
The skin file defines the look of the jukebox and the scheme by which
songs are selected. All interactive elements of the interface can be
defined here. The skin file is set via the Skin parameter in
JUKEBOX.INI; the default is DEFAULT.SKN. Although the skin files
included have a .SKN extension, they are still effectively INI files and
can be edited with any text editor.
