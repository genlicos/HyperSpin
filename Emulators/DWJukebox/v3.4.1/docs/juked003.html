<p>
In order to interact with the skin, the jukebox sends status 
messages to the skin and can receive control messages from icons
mapped to locations on the screen.

<p>
When a message is received that matches the Action setting of an 
icon, that icon's OnImage is displayed, and when the negative 
version of the message is received, the icon reverts to its OffImage.
More than one icon can have the same Action, but each icon can only 
have one Action. If no OnImage is defined, the OffImage will appear 
down and to the right as if "pressed" in like a button.  If no 
OffImage is specified, the background image in the area specified 
by the icon is used.

<p>
An Action may contain any of the button definitions listed above.  
When a button definition is used, the icon will move to the OnImage 
state for a tenth of a second, and then return to the OffImage state.
If the icon is marked as Clickable, it will send the button command as 
well as receive it. 

<p>
In addition to button messages, there are several state messages that 
can be assigned as actions.  State messages should not be marked as 
Clickable, as they are not commands.  State messages are often used 
to activate "lights" on the jukebox, indicating credits being 
available, that a song is paused, that radio mode is turned on, etc.
This is done by putting an image of a turned-on lamp for the icon's 
OnImage and of an unlit lamp for the OffImage.

<p>
The state messages are:

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="MSG_FILTERED">MSG_FILTERED</a></b></div><br>
Activated when a filter is in place; deactivated when the filter is 
cleared.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="MSG_POPULAR">MSG_POPULAR</a></b></div><br>
Activated when the Most Popular list is shown; deactivated when the 
Song Queue display is restored.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="MSG_CREDITS">MSG_CREDITS</a></b></div><br>
Activated when one or more credits are available; deactivated when 
no credits are remaining. When the jukebox is set to not require 
credits, this message is always active.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="MSG_SONGSTART">MSG_SONGSTART</a></b></div><br>
Activated when a song is playing; deactivated when the song 
finishes.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="MSG_SONGPAUSE">MSG_SONGPAUSE</a></b></div><br>

deactivated when play is resumed. 

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="MSG_START">MSG_START</a></b></div><br>
Activated when the jukebox is started. Note that this message is never
deactivated, so you cannot use this message to trigger shutdown events,
as the shutdown happens too quickly for the jukebox to respond to.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="MSG_START_SKIN">MSG_START_SKIN</a></b></div><br>
Activated when a new skin starts. This is the default action, and
can be used to essentially apply "decals" to the jukebox without having
to edit the skin background image. Note that this message is never
deactivated, so you cannot use this message to trigger skin shutdown 
events, as the shutdown happens too quickly for the jukebox to respond 
to.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="MSG_ISDOS">MSG_ISDOS</a></b></div><br>
Activated for DOS, deactivated for Windows. Useful if you wanted to 
show a different decal depending on which version is running.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="MSG_RADIO">MSG_RADIO</a></b></div><br>
Activated when RadioMode is started; deactivated when RadioMode

<br><center><h2><a name="Command Messages">Command Messages</a></h2></center><p>

<p>
A command message is similar to a BTN_ message; however, they are not 
sent in pairs, i.e. there is never a deactivation for them. Commands
are meant to trigger actions in the jukebox as opposed to triggering
GUI actions. These are not usually used as icon actions; they are used 
internally by timers.  Command messages are not sent to the GUI so 
they should not be used by non-clickable icons, and clickable icons 
will not appear to "press" if mapped to a command message.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="CMD_ADDCREDIT">CMD_ADDCREDIT</a></b></div><br>
If the skin is set to add multiple credits one at a 
time, this command is sent once for each credit to instruct the jukebox
to increase the credit counter.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="CMD_NEXTPG">CMD_NEXTPG</a></b></div><br>
Turns to the next page of songs.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b> <a name="CMD_PREVPG">CMD_PREVPG</a></b></div><br>
Turns to the previous page of songs.
