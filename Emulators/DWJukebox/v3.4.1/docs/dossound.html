<h1><a name="DOSCab: Sound card compatibility list ">DOSCab: Sound card compatibility list </a></h1>

<p>
Many of my support queries have to do with trying to find a sound card 
in DOS that works.  Unfortunately, the official list of cards is pretty 
limited: the SoundBlaster 1.0, SoundBlaster 1.5, SoundBlaster 2.0, 
SoundBlaster Pro, SoundBlaster 16, ESS Audiodrive, Ensoniq Soundscape, 
and Windows Sound System.  All of these cards are ISA (with the 
exception of WSS, which I think is found on some old integrated 
chipsets).  Any card that is 100% hardware compatible with one of these 
cards should work.  

<p>
For sound cards that don't work, either sound won't initialize and 
DOSCab will error out, or it will initialize as a SoundBlaster but when 
attempting to play a song the song will get stuck at 0:00. 

<p>
Because of declining support for DOS among sound card manufacturers, 
there is little I can do to make more recent cards work with DOSCab.

<p>
Here is a list of cards known to be working with DOSCab:

<ul>
<li>Creative Labs SoundBlaster 1.0
<li>Creative Labs SoundBlaster 1.5
<li>Creative Labs SoundBlaster 2.0
<li>Creative Labs SoundBlaster Pro
<li>Creative Labs SoundBlaster 16 ISA
<li>Creative Labs SoundBlaster 32 ISA
<li>Creative Labs SoundBlaster 64 ISA
