SECTION 1: Typodermic Freeware Fonts End User License Agreement
---------------------------------------------------------------


The Typodermic fonts contained in this file are free to use for personal 
and/or commercial purposes. No payment is necessary to use these fonts for
personal or commercial use. For Software Products who want to include 
these fonts, see the License Agreement below. You can add this font to a 
website but do not combine fonts into a single archive or alter them in 
any way.

Payment:

No payment is required for the use of this font unless it is included with
software. See the license agreement for more details. This font is part of
a larger family of fonts available at www.typodermic.com. If you find this
font useful, please check out the rest of the font family as well as the 
other fonts Typodermic has to offer. Several other fonts have free 
versions available. If you have technical problems with this font, visit 
Typodermic to ensure that you have the latest version. Many fonts have 
several versions available on various font sites on the web, many of which 
are older versions.

Font installation help is available at http://www.myfonts.com/support

Q: How can I use this font in AOL Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Outlook, 
Outlook Express, Euodora or any other email software? 
A: At the time of this writing (October 2004) you can’t. After installing 
one of my fonts, you may be able to select it in the above applications
but the person at the other end won’t see that same thing unless they 
have the font installed. If you really want to use my fonts in these 
applications, make sure the people at the other end have the same fonts 
installed.

Q: How can I use these fonts on a web page? 
A: If you’re creating a web page using Flash, it’s easy. Consult your Flash 
manual. If you’re using Acrobat, make sure the font embedding settings 
are turned on. Consult your Acrobat manual. For anything else there are 
limitations: If you want to use one of my fonts as your main, text font 
you’re pretty much out of luck unless you explore a font embedding tool 
such as WEFT but I don’t recommend it. To use my fonts as headings or 
titles, use image creation software such as The Gimp, Photoshop, Paint 
Shop Pro, Pixia etc. Save the images as GIF files and place them on your 
web page. There’s a lot more to it than can be explained here but there 
are countless books available on web page design. 

Q: How can I make these fonts bigger? 
A: All my fonts are infinitely scalable; the limitations are in your software.
A common problem is scaling fonts in Microsoft Word. If you choose 
Format / Font you can type in any number you like under “size”. 

Q: Are these fonts really free? 
A: Yes they are. 

Q: I saw this font on another web site under the name Larabie Fonts, why is it
listed as Typodermic now? 
A: Larabie Fonts and Typodermic were both started by Ray Larabie. This font 
may have been originally released under Larabie Fonts. Before Typodermic 
existed, several freeware fonts from Larabie Fonts had expanded families 
available sold as Deluxe versions. When Typodermic came into existence in 
2001,the Deluxe fonts were gradually renamed and moved to the Typodermic 
foundry. 

Q: Is this font the same as the “pay” version of the font? For example: is 
Zekton Free the same as Zekton regular? 
A: Yes. There is no difference in the quality or completeness between the 
free version and the pay version; only the name and license agreement is 
different. If you downloaded this font from a site other then Typodermic or
MyFonts.com, you should visit Typodermic and download the latest version. 

Q: Why would I pay for this font when I already have it for free? 
A: If you visit Typodermic you can see the difference. The version of the 
font for sale comes with several different styles, making it much more versatile. 
You can purchase the whole font family for what some foundries charge for a single 
font! 

Q: Your licence agreement states that the fonts can’t be altered. Does that mean
I can’t mess around with your fonts in Photoshop/Illustrator/Publisher etc? 
A: Those license restrictions refer to altering the actual fonts themselves, 
not what you make with them. As long as you don’t alter the font files in font 
creation software such as FontLab or Fontographer you’re free to create anything 
you like with them. 

Q: Can I use your fonts in a logo? 
A: Yes. But check with a lawyer if you’re not sure. It’s okay with me if you use it 
but do so at your own risk. 

Q: Can I send you a sample of the nifty thing I created with your fonts? 
A: Of course. Check www.typodermic.com/about.html for my current email or 
mailing address. 

Q: Can you make a custom font for me? 
A: Possibly. Check www.typodermic.com/custom.html for details. 

Q: I want to sell software that includes you font files. 
A: Contact me first at www.typodermic.com/about.html 

Q: I want to sell rubber stamp alphabets, alphabet punches or stencil alphabets using
your font designs. 
A: Contact me first at www.typodermic.com/about.html. 

Q: My software won’t let me embed one of your fonts. 
A: You may have an old version of one of the fonts from Larabie Fonts. Uninstall it 
and install a current version. 

Q: Can you help me find a font? 
A: Yes, but don’t email me with your question. Please post your question on the 
Larabie Fonts font forum: www.larabiefonts.com/info.html.

The fonts are distributed under the following copyright:

Copyright FAQ
=============

   1. I don't understand the resale restriction... What gives?

      Bitstream is giving away these fonts, but wishes to ensure its
      competitors can't just drop the fonts as is into a font sale system
      and sell them as is. It seems fair that if Bitstream can't make money
      from the Bitstream Vera fonts, their competitors should not be able to
      do so either. You can sell the fonts as part of any software package,
      however.

   2. I want to package these fonts separately for distribution and
      sale as part of a larger software package or system.  Can I do so?

      Yes. A RPM or Debian package is a "larger software package" to begin 
      with, and you aren't selling them independently by themselves. 
      See 1. above.

   3. Are derivative works allowed?
      Yes!

   4. Can I change or add to the font(s)?
      Yes, but you must change the name(s) of the font(s).

   5. Under what terms are derivative works allowed?

      You must change the name(s) of the fonts. This is to ensure the
      quality of the fonts, both to protect Bitstream and Gnome. We want to
      ensure that if an application has opened a font specifically of these
      names, it gets what it expects (though of course, using fontconfig,
      substitutions could still could have occurred during font
      opening). You must include the Bitstream copyright. Additional
      copyrights can be added, as per copyright law. Happy Font Hacking!

   6. If I have improvements for Bitstream Vera, is it possible they might get 
       adopted in future versions?

      Yes. The contract between the Gnome Foundation and Bitstream has
      provisions for working with Bitstream to ensure quality additions to
      the Bitstream Vera font family. Please contact us if you have such
      additions. Note, that in general, we will want such additions for the
      entire family, not just a single font, and that you'll have to keep
      both Gnome and Jim Lyles, Vera's designer, happy! To make sense to add
      glyphs to the font, they must be stylistically in keeping with Vera's
      design. Vera cannot become a "ransom note" font. Jim Lyles will be
      providing a document describing the design elements used in Vera, as a
      guide and aid for people interested in contributing to Vera.

   7. I want to sell a software package that uses these fonts: Can I do so?

      Sure. Bundle the fonts with your software and sell your software
      with the fonts. That is the intent of the copyright.

   8. If applications have built the names "Bitstream Vera" into them, 
      can I override this somehow to use fonts of my choosing?

      This depends on exact details of the software. Most open source
      systems and software (e.g., Gnome, KDE, etc.) are now converting to
      use fontconfig (see www.fontconfig.org) to handle font configuration,
      selection and substitution; it has provisions for overriding font
      names and subsituting alternatives. An example is provided by the
      supplied local.conf file, which chooses the family Bitstream Vera for
      "sans", "serif" and "monospace".  Other software (e.g., the XFree86
      core server) has other mechanisms for font substitution.
