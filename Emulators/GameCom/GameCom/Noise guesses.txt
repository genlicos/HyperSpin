    The documentation is a bit vague.
 
    It says that the output is fCK/ "cycle divided" time constant, where fCK
is 10Mhz (a very high value) and time constant is between 0-4095.  That
would mean an output range of 10Mhz to 2442hz (with an output frequency of
5Mhz to 1221hz).
 
    It doesn't say anything about the internal noise algorithm...
 
    The "cycle divided" bit could be significant, especially as the top
frequency is so high.  One guess could be to divide it by 32 (the number of
steps used for the waveform of the other two channels), which would give an
output range of 312.5Khz to 76.3hz (freq 156.25Khz to 38.15hz).  That would
move it a bit closer to the Game Gear's (approx) 220Khz to 429hz (freq
110Khz to 214hz).
 
    Erm....  quite a lot of guesswork there...  So try multiplying your old
GG noise freq reg by 1.5 when feeding it into the Game.Com SG2TL/SG2TH time
constant register....  and see how it goes...  Not sure if that's much help.
 
    bye,
