What I need is simple:
 
An object module that can be linked into the game with the following entry
points:
 
Play a sound effect (passed as a number in a register)
Play a song (passed as a number in a register)
kill current sound effect(s)
Kill current song
Pause all sound effects and songs
Unpause all sound effects and songs (continue from where paused)
 
If there will be a need for some songs to be programmatically repeated, then
I also need an entry point to test if a song is still playing.

playing.
 
Besides that I need a list of numbered songs.  Loading the corresponding
number into the correct register and calling the play song routine would
play that song until replaced with another song or the kill song routine is
called.

would play that sound effect until it ends, is replaced with another song or
the kill sound effect routine is called.
