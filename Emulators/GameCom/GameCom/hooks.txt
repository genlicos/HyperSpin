 
In the level tables definition, we could place hooks to define.  There is a
set of labels in mel.asm and mel.inc that define the names of the songs.
These are potenrial label names we could use.  We would just have to figure
out how to tell the system the song uses both waveform channels (two songs
playing simultaneously on SG0 and SG1) or just one (playing one song on
SG0 -and playing SFX SG1)
